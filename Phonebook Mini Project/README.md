# About Phonebook Mini Project

Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application (as shown in the main menu screenshot below).

Personal information such as name, sex, father’s name, phone number, citizenship number, email and address are asked while adding a record into the Phonebook. These records can then be modified, listed, searched for and removed.

I have used many functions in this mini project. These functions are easy to understand as their name only signifies their respective operations.

- void menu() – This function is used to display the main menu.
- void start() – This functions calls the menu function mentioned above.
- void back() – This function is used to go back to start.
- void addrecord() – It adds a new Phonebook record.
- void listrecord() – This function is used to view list of added records in file.
- void modifyrecord() – This function is used to modify added records.
- void deleterecord() – It deletes record from file.
- void searchrecord() – It searches for added record by name.
